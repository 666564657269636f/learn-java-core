He eats kids, good or bad ones. They all taste the same to him. He comes
once a year and eats kids. Mostly retards and waterheads but he eats
some regular ones too. He likes to shrink himself and hide inside kids
pillows. Then he wait for kid to go to sleep, then *CRUNCH* he bites off
head. Yummy!!! I like head. He come Christmass eve and eat till full,
usualy 7-9 kids a year then he go to sleep and wait till next time.

**[GuessNumber.java]** Write a program implementing a simple quiz game. The computer selects a random number between 0
and 3 then ask the user to guess the number. The game ends when the user correctly guesses the number 0.
(see java.util.random.RandomGenerator, java.util.Scanner).

**[MonkeyTrouble]** We have two monkeys, a and b, and two boolean values (aSmile and bSmile) indicate if each is smiling. 
We are in trouble if they are both smiling or if neither of them is smiling. 
Write a program asking the user if monkeys are smiling and print an alert if we are in trouble (see java.util.Scanner).

**[TheRightPrice]** The computer selects a random number between [0, 100] representing the price of an imaginary item.
Two users are asked to guess the right price. The user which proposed the number closer to the right price wins.
Note that Math.abs(n) returns the absolute value of a number (see java.util.random.RandomGenerator, java.util.Scanner).



**[InterestRate]** Write a program that prints the balance of an account after the first, second, and third year. 
The account has an initial balance of $1,000 and earns 5 percent interest per year.
